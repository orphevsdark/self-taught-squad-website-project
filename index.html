                You may wonder how a nerdy East Indian boy born and raised 
                in Southern California met a wonderful Italian/English girl 
                from Illinois. The oddest thing about about
                that story is that Victoria and Vikram met through their
                common connections to the city of Bozeman, Montana. When 
                Vikram was working in technology marketing in Bozeman, he 
                was fortunate enough to make many great friends there, some
                of whom knew Victoria from the time when she lived in Bozeman
                while completing her Bachelor's degree at Montana State University.
                In 2014, when Victoria was passing through town to ready herself
                for a move away from Montana, a mutual friend of Victoria nad 
                Vikram introduced the two and they very quickly found themselves
                strongly attracted to one another. After a whirlwind beginning 
                to their relationship, Victoria and Vikram realized in the Fall
                of 2014 that they had found something special together and chose 
                to build a long-distance relationship together despite Victoria's
                educational goals taking her away from Montana to pursue her 
                Master's degree in a town in Idaho  that required over seven 
                hours to reach by car from Bozeman. Despite the distance, Victoria 
                and Vikram realized that the love hey share is worth the effort
                required to keep it strong, Even if they are far apart. After
                experiencing an amazing series of ups and downs together, Vikram 
                proposed to Victoria in the Summer of 2016. Now, after Victoria
                and Vikram have waited patiently for the timing to work out 
                well, it turns out that 2020 will be the year for Victoria 
                and Vikram to officially tie the knot.</p>
